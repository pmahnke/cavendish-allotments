They may be small at the moment, but very soon the courgettes, tomatoes, beans and all your other crops are going to be bursting out. How do you deal with the glut? Make chutneys, main dishes, puddings, cakes, wine? Recipe suggestions please to the editor.

To start the ball rolling, here's one from Michael, adapted from Nigel Slater's "Real Fast Food":http://www.amazon.co.uk/Real-Fast-Food-Ready-Eat/dp/0140469494 recipe book.

Try cooking your green beans in vegetable stock spiked with a little chilli (this works well when they get a bit old and stringy):

Top and tail the beans, chop roughly and fry in a little vegetable oil with some chopped spring onion and a small chilli pepper. After a few minutes, pour in enough vegetable stock to just cover the beans. Then simmer for 6 or 7 minutes. Delicious, especially when served with spare ribs or pork chops!
