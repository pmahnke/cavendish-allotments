Whilst it is a formal requirement that we hold an Annual General Meeting, it is by no means a formal occasion.  We invite you all to attend -- especially new members -- to air your views and exchange ideas.  We want to hear from you as this helps us to present a comprehensive picture to the Council of our members' views, so do come along and have your say.

The agenda will include breif reports from the chair and treasurer, notes of last year's AGM, election of a new committee and, most important of all, views from the allotment members.

The AGM will be held on *Sunday 23<sup>rd</sup> of November at 3pm* at the Winchester Hall, next door to the Turks Head pub, Winchester Road, St Margarets.
