Our noticeboard is falling to bits! A request was made to the council but all funds are going to updating the water supplies to all sites. However, the council tells us that they will supply &pound;50 towards the costs of materials. So, is there a kind plot-holder who would be willing to make a new one? The supports apppear to be strong, so just a solid wooden frame and an opening perspex door is needed. If anyone is keen, please contact Michael Thierens (16).
