In this week of sub-zero temperatures, you may appreciate a cheering reminder that Spring really is just around the corner, as Chapman's Garden Centre in Twickenham already has seed potatoes, onion and shallot sets for sale.

For the uninitiated, Chapman's is the sweet shop of seed potatoes!  It has a vast selection of varieties available and the growing and cooking characteristics of each variety are described. Also, unlike stores where you have to buy by the kilo, you can buy as many or as few of any variety you fancy, so it's perfect for trying things out on an allotment.

It's hard to believe that we could soon be swapping our beloved roasties and mash for steamed jersey royals and red onion salad!

You can find Chapman's at "2-4 Colne Rd Twickenham TW1 4JP":https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Percy+Chapman+%26+Son+Ltd/@51.4511748,-0.337237,15z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x48760c8e6f7415e7:0x76aaf2ac5cff206!2sPercy+Chapman+%26+Son+Ltd!8m2!3d51.4453411!4d-0.3383352!3m4!1s0x48760c8e6f7415e7:0x76aaf2ac5cff206!8m2!3d51.4453411!4d-0.3383352. It is easy to reach on foot or by bus, being located on a corner with Heath Road, just beside the railway bridge approaching Twickenham Green.
