The Open Day will be held earlier this year, maybe in late May. Would the Bank Holiday weekend, 26 May or 27 May be a good time? Or do most people prefer it later or earlier?

Whichever date it is, when you are sowing seeds now, please sow a few extra to be potted up for sale on the Open Day. Everyone likes getting a few extra plants, and the sale is a good source of funds.
