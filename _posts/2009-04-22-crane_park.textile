In a London-wide competition to gain government funding for its boroughs' local parks, Crane Park is one of ten to receive &pound;400,000 each. FORCE (Friends of the River Crane Environment) said that the money will be used to open up parts currently inaccessible, improve footpaths, cycle paths and picnic areas, install more benches, signs and information areas, develop further the nature reserve on the island, deal with graffiti and rubbish and extend the park from Hounslow Heath towards Twickenham.
