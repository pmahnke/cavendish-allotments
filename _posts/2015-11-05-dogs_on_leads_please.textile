Most dogs brought onto the site are very well controlled and kept on a lead all the time.

However a plot holder's dog was seen running around this summer while its owner tried to catch it, and another plot holder witnessed a dog urinating on their crops!

The council's rules state: "Dogs must not be brought onto allotments or any part of the site unless kept on a lead at all times and controlled by owners so as not to annoy or inconvenience other tenants."

So while dogs are welcome on site, please keep them on a lead.
