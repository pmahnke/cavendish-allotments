For those who weren't at the AGM here is an opportunity to buy vegetable & flower seeds at a substantial discount.

It is available to members of the NSALG (National Society of Allotment & Leisure Gardeners) and costs &pound;2.50 for membership until end of 2015, increasing to &pound;2.75 from 1<sup>st</sup> Jan 2016.

This cost is easily offset if you buy a few packets of seeds.

The Seed Scheme is organised by Toni Francis (plot 4) for Cavendish House plot holders.

If you are interested get in touch with Toni as soon as possible via "enquiries@cavendish-allotments.org.uk":mailto:enquiries@cavendish-allotments.org.uk for a catalogue.
