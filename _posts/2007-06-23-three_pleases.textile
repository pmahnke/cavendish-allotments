# Please always lock the gate, after you enter and when you leave. A plot-holder recently had a wheelbarrow stolen and two others lost garden chairs. It's not known how this happened, but we do need to be security conscious.
# Please don't put waste like glass, wood, old carpets, etc. by the bin. The council will not take it away, it looks unsightly and could be dangerous.
# Please, parents, although it is very good to see children taking part in allotment life, do make sure they don't go onto other people's plots. Children's safety is always your own responsibility.
