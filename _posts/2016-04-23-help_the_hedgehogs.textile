h4. Hedgehog tips

* Hedgehogs forage at night; they eat snails, slugs, insects and worms (slow worms also eat slugs and snails). Milk makes hedgehogs sick (just like bread bloats birds).
* Obstacles for hedgehogs are chemicals, disturbance, machinery, roads, lack of green corridors to roam, lack of wild areas to forage, breed and hibernate.
* Hedgehogs like spiky leaf litter piles, bramble and long grasses to give birth in June/July and hibernate in the winter from October until March/April.
* Badgers and foxes eat hedgehogs.
* Hedgehogs are a great garden friend as they eat our garden pests.
* Hedgehogs rely on hearing and smell more than eyesight.
* Hazards for hedgehogs are strimmers, mowers, pesticide/herbicide chemicals and slug pellets.
* Organic chemical products are just as bad as non-organic; residues of toxic chemicals have been found in vegetables in areas where chemicals are used; such as sprays and pellets e.g. Glyphosate acid. These chemicals are harmful to us and the food chain.
* Companion and sacrificial planting are good alternatives, as well as beer traps and other natural methods.
