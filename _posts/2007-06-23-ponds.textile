A few holders have ponds on their plots. The pros are that they can attract wildlife, especially frogs and toads, and water-loving plants can be grown. The cons are they can be a breeding area for mosquitoes and there is the possibility of danger to children and others. If you have a pond, put in oxygenating plants to keep the water from becoming stagnant and cover the pond with a strong wire mesh.
