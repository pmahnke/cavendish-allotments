A greenhouse has been erected in the car park. This is a recent generous donation and has been assembled by a very hard-working Paul Leonard with some volunteer help.  Paul writes: 

bq. "The donation of the greenhouse for communal use provides Cavendish plot-holders with opportunities to raise seedlings and store sensitive plants, with swapping and sharing of plants if wished. As part of the ethos of using it, it is hoped there will be opportunities to involve people with physical difficulties and those in wheelchairs.  At the AGM on 14 November, there will be discussion on how the nine bays can be equitably allocated."

Things to think about include: 

* How long should someone have use of a bay?
* Organise a rota?
* Make a charge?
* Cost of and dealing with any repairs?
* Administration - by whom and how?
