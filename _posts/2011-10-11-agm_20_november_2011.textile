<em>Sunday 20 November, 2.30-4.30pmâ€¨ at the "Turks Head's Winchester Hall":http://www.stmgrts.org.uk/directory/pub/200505231518.</em>

There is always a lot to learn about and discuss at the AGM. The past year has been a busy one for our site, for example - on the initiative of Paul Leonard, our new Chair, we  have a new greenhouse whose bays can be booked for a season for a small charge; missing plot markers have been made and installed through the work of several volunteers; an incinerator for anyone's use has been bought; we have a mobile phone. Also, the council is forging stronger links with its allotment sites and wants to know the views of holders. Rental fees are going up; should the council do more for us - what do you think? So, please come along, to listen, comment or question. And if you wish, contact Paul beforehand with any topic you'd like to raise.
