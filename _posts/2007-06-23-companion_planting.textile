In the last newsletter, we touched on companion planting. This can be a very beneficial approach to natural gardening, in terms of both pest control, and in helping pollination.

The common marigold ("Tagetes patula":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagetes_patula) and Meadow Foam ("Limanthes dougasii":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limnanthes_douglasii), also known as 'poached-egg flower' are perfect habitats for ladybirds and lacewings, which are natural devourers of aphids, etc. Similarly, Californian Poppy ("Eschscholzia":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschscholzia), fennel and alliums also attract beneficial predators.

A wonderful addition this summer is "Hilliers Nurseries":http://www.hillier.co.uk/nurs.htm selling larvae of both ladybirds and lacewings which you can release on your plot. The nearest Hillier garden centre is in Sunningdale, just off junction 3 of the M3, or you can phone them on 01344 623 166.

The carrot fly can also be a pest but interplanting double rows of onions between each row of carrots can help to deter them, as Sue O'Callaghan has proven (see "Top tips":http://www.cavendish-allotments.org.uk/2007/06/top_tips.html).
