We would like to revive this as an information exchange point. Anyone can put up a postcard-sized notice - plants offered, seed swaps, requests, etc. Include the date and your plot number.

Also, you might have noticed, the board itself is in bad shape.  If anyone is able to either repair or replace it, please contact a member of the committee.  We have requested a new one from the council but don't know if/when we will get one. Information such as when compost delivery is made is put on to it.
