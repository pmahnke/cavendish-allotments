Recently, there have been two very successful working parties tidying and sorting the car park and communal composting area. Thanks to all those who gave their time - you have helped make such a difference.

There will be another on 15<sup>th</sup> November 2015 at 3pm when all offers of help will be appreciated. To coincide with this, horse manure will be available to take at 50p per barrow or bag.
