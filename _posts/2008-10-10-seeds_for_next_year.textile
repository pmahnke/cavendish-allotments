Toni Francis has kindly agreed again to organise the purchase of seed and sundries from the catalogue of the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners.  There's a very wind range, the seeds are of good quality and are cheaper than in the shops.

To join the scheme, you need to pay &pound;1.75 to Toni for membership of the NSALG and can then obtain the catalogie (available in November -- and at our AGM) from her.

Contact Toni at  plot 4 or on 020 8287 5120.  Your order needs to be with her before 31 January 2009.
