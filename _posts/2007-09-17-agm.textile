This yearâ€™s AGM will be held at the Winchester Hall (adjoining the Turks Head pub in Winchester Road) on Sunday 18 November, 3 to 4.30pm. During this last year, many plot-holders have commented on the good atmosphere on the site. 

Perhaps you have ideas on what could be done next year? So please come and discuss them! 

Soft drinks and snacks will be served.
