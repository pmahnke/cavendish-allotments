Following delays in deliveries last year we are trying a new supplier.

The 80L bags are bigger and better value than before.

100% organic composted stable manure peat free and weed free.

At &pound;3.00 per bag the 80L bags are 60% bigger and better value than the former 50L bags.

Each bag will cover 2 square metres to a depth of 2.5cm.

Sign up on allotment site noticeboards or email <a href="mailto:enquiries@cavendish-allotments.org.uk">enquiries@cavendishÂ­-allotments.org.uk</a>

First delivery expected on Friday March 4
