The water works has started and should be finished by early next week.

Look for the red paint marks to see where the new stand pipes will be.

The old water butts will no longer be fed directly from the water mains and will have to be refilled by hose.  The old standpipes will no longer work.

The mains pressure will be increased, so watering should be quicker.
