2×2 Opera returns with its fourth production later this month with Keith Cheetham's 70 minute adaptation of Bizet's Carmen. Once again, the production draws on the talents of children and young people from local schools both on and off stage. Schools taking part this year include St Stephen's, Orleans Park, Waldegrave, Hampton, Putney High, and Esher College.

However, help is needed!



2×2 Opera are currently in need of scenery builders for the afternoon of Sunday 25th March at All Souls Church. If you are handy with a hammer / screwdriver and would like to help, please contact Deborah: deborah.meyer@meyermusic.co.uk
