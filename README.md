# cavendish-allotments

This repo contains the jekyll files that create the website for www.cavendish-allotments.org.uk, an allotment outside of London in St Margarets.

## Building the site

To run the site, you need to:

1. pull down this repo
2. create a new [Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/) ```jekyll new``` 
3. build the site with something like ```jekyll build -I --source <GIT_REPO_DIRECTORY> --destination <WEBSITE_DIRECTORY>```.

## Notes

* the site's css is based largely on [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), but uses the typography from [Vanilla framework](http://docs.vanillaframework.io)
* in time, I plan to move the whole site to Vanilla
